Design decisions:
1. Since this is an IO intensive app (rather than CPU intensive app), we will go with non-blocking from top-down.
    a. The HTTP server is chosen to be goliath.
    b. HTTP client is chosen to be em-http-request.
2. Fiber pool
3. Anemic domain

Setup instructions:
1. Should have ruby 2.2.2 & ruby devkit installed
2. Run the following commands to run the app and then hit http://localhost:9000 in your browser:
    gem install bundle
    bundle install
    rake run

3. To run tests:
    rake

Note: This is my first ever ruby project. I have taken decisions based on my experience with building applications in other
languages (Scala, Java, etc). I may not have taken the best decisions and may not haven written idiomatic Ruby.
